4. Using AM layer, create a secondary index on a repeating (non-unique) attribute of a file (whose records are not in the key order) using two approaches : a) using bucket of pointers, and b) making keys unique by appending them with serial number or primary key of the records. Study space and performance characteristics of the two approaches for a selected set of queries. Use AM layer to create primary index but write B+ tree algorithms of your own (or extend the AM layer appropriately) to create the secondary index in (a) above.
